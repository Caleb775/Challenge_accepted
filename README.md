HTML and CSS git challange #1

This is my Challenge 1 with the requirment to make the mock up example have a 
better functionality with semantic HTML elements, a cleaner structure, alt attributes for images and icons,
and a title.

I also added a aqua color for when I hover over the nav links in the header and matched it with 
the Seo part of the text in the H1 element.
